# ChatGuard: AI-Powered Robustness Tester for Conversational Agents

## Project Overview
Chatbots drive apps in healthcare, finance, and beyond, but they falter on complex or adversarial questions, risking unreliable, biased, or unsafe responses. This undermines trust and can cause harm. Developers lack automated tools to systematically test reliability. ChatGuard uses AI to stress-test chatbots, delivering insights to ensure robust, safe performance.

## Team
- [Gaurav Sharma] – Lead Developer
- [Aalap Goswami] – AI Model Specialist
- [Himanshu Singh Chouhan] – UI/UX Designer
- [Amandeep Singh Rathore] – Data Engineer
*Note: Update with actual names and roles.*

## Feasibility Plan
- **Weeks 1–2 (Research & Design):** Analyze benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA), define metrics (accuracy, bias), and mock up UI/architecture.
- **Weeks 3–6 (Development):** Build prompt generation (GPT-4o), evaluation (Moderation API), and Streamlit dashboard, integrating LangChain and Pinecone/Weaviate.
- **Weeks 7–8 (Testing & Refinement):** Test on open-source chatbots, iterate, and document.
- **Week 9 (Deployment):** Host on Heroku, create demo video.

## Progress
- [ ] Initial setup and README created.
- [ ] Prompt generation module in progress.
- [ ] Demo video and dashboard to be added post-development.
